# Doctor-Visits-Analysis--GLM-Model
This project combines two analyses: the first focuses on house prices using the Gamma Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and the second examines the number of doctor visits using data from the 1977â€“1978 Australian Health Survey. The goal is to explore the relationships between predictor variables and the respective response variables in both cases.
